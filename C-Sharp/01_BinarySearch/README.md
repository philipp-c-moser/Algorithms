# 1. Binary Search
The binary search will call the number in the middle and exclude the half of remaining numbers.


## How does it work?
The algorithm should search a value in a list of 100 items.

I will start searching at the middle of the list. This will be 50.
By checking, if the value 50 is to large or to small, we can exclude the half of the values.

If the value 50 is to small, we will start a next try and divide the next element. This will be than 75.
