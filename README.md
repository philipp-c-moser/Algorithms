# Algorithms

### Description
Learning the implementation of Search-, Sort-, and Recommendation Algorithms in C#, Java and Swift.


### My Goals
My goal is to learn and document the implementation of different popular Search-, Sort- and Recommendation Algorithms in C#, Java and Swift. At the end I will try to implement a larger Graph-Algorithm to find the shortest way to a defined goal in a path-network.
